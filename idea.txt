I really want to make this app because I really want this app in my life.

The keys to the app are:
- easy to enter new todo items
- app relatively accurately prioritized your events
- it makes it really easy to update activities

Entering a new item to your todo list
- item to do (obviously)
- importance (not very, moderate, important, very important)
- due date (can just enter a year, year and month,... so and so forth until time of day)
- approximate time it takes (not sure, options for detail down to hours or just a little / a lot?)
- if missed remove?
- recurring (more options if this is case)
    - how often recurs
    - increase priority if missed one/more? (put chores in, not bad if missed once, bad if missed 10 times)
- time / place specific (only displays as todo if that time or place?)
   - the time or place


update list
- complete an item (obviously, move to accomplishments?)
- change any attributes (not a common action)
- mark something worked on (lowers the time to take somehow)


The app might have a widget that displays the top like 5 priority items then open app for full list.

This is the skeleton. I think there is room to make it less scary to use / update and therefore people like us would actually use it.

Will you be my app buddy? And can I invite someone else?


notifications asking you if you need to update any items? 
templates for certain items (like a chore profile, or work project profile)

due date notifications, need to work on these things notifications
